title: Data Abstraction and Return to Data Tables

Between the last 2 weeks of class we spoke about data abstractions and returned to learning about data sets. To do so we looked at two data simulations. First, our teacher shared with us a program containing a simulation of a drone dropping a box and we had to figure out how to get the box to land going in a diagonal line. At first this seemed really confusing to me and honestly still is pretty confusing to think about but I will try to the best of my ability to try to make sense of it in this reflection. We talked about using mames of data in order to oragnize it to do something for us and as an example we used a function that used constructor data called "DeliveryState" which takes in two numbers and and used them as coordinates in a way. Using this data we can create a fuction called delivery and the contract will look something like this:

<br/>
delivery::(x::Number,::y::Number)->Delivery state
<br/>

This function will produce a fuction that will produce the delivery state of the function which is a type of data. As you can see the function takes in two values one of which we see is represents the coordinates of where the delivey state leave the package. It takes in both the Y values and X values of delivery and this will solve the presented problem of the simulation. As I said before, the explanation was a little confusing so I'm not sure if I'm presenting my information correctly however I do have some understanding when I look in my notes taliking about data stuctures and abstractions

We also returned to talking about data tables by revisting the data tables that displayed a table of animals
