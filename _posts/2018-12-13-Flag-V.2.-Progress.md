This week we began programing our flag in pyret. We were each presented with 2 different flags. My options were to create a program in order to produce a vector image of either the Norway flag or the United states flag. Even though the flag of Norway IS interesting, I chose to recreate the United States flag because it qualified for the professional level grade and seemed more complex and I really wanted a challenge. 

So far my code is pretty basic nothing that big right now, 
<br/>
<br/>
\\\
<br/>
include image<br/>
include image-structs<br/>
#--proportions--#<br/>
size = 100<br/>
width = size * 1.9<br/>
height = size * 1<br/>
SH = (height / 13)<br/>
SW = size * 1.9<br/>
BW = size * 0.5385<br/>
BL = size * 0.76<br/>
#--basic shapes--#<br/>
WR = rectangle(width, height, "solid", "white")<br/>
RS = rectangle(width, SH, "solid", "red")<br/>
BR = rectangle(BL, BW, "solid", "blue")<br/>
#--place image code--#<br/>
CR = place-image(RS, SW,SH, WR)<br/>
\\\
<br/>
<br/> 
what you see above includes code that controls the proportions of the flag by using the size attribute in order to update the size of the entire image. this part of the code is operational which is a good thing now all I need to do is make sure that I have all the basic shapes I need in order to make up the flag and to overlap the basic images in order to make the flag come out. I have also begun placing images using the place-image function however, I have only placed one stripe so far.
<br/>
<br/>
I also was trying to figure out how to get the <strong>include</strong> image-structs library work so I can get the exact colors of the United States flag since they are not exact just red white and blue as it turns out. The actual names of the colors are actually Old Glory blue and Old Glory red and then white. 
<br/>
<br/>
My flag is still a work in progress as you can see below:

<br/>
We still have one week to complete our projects however, my main problem right now is that the image structs library doesnt work properly at the moment since the code keeps on giving me an error message saying that something is off so I have been spending time figuring that out however, I think I should do this later in order to spend more time getting the exact look of the flag THEN worry about the colors. Doing this will save more time and actually produce a project by next week.
