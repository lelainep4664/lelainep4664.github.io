This week we began programing our flag in pyret. We were each presented with 2 different flags one on each

<br/>
include image<br/>
include image-structs<br/>
size = 100<br/>
width = size * 1.9<br/>
height = size * 1<br/>
SH = (height / 13)<br/>
SW = size * 1.9<br/>
BW = size * 0.5385<br/>
BL = size * 0.76<br/>
WR = rectangle(width, height, "solid", "white")<br/>
RS = rectangle(width, SH, "solid", "red")<br/>
BR = rectangle(BL, BW, "solid", "blue")<br/>
CR = place-image(RS, SW,SH, WR)<br/>
