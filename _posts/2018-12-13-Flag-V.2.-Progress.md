This week we began programing our flag in pyret. We were each presented with 2 different flags. My options were to create a program in order to produce a vector image of either the Norway flag or the United states flag. Even though the flag of Norway IS interesting, I chose to recreate the United States flag because it qualified for the professional level grade and seemed more complex and I really wanted a challenge. 

So far my code is pretty basic nothing that big right now, 
<br/>
<br/>
\\\
<br/>
include image<br/>
include image-structs<br/>
#--proportions--#
size = 100<br/>
width = size * 1.9<br/>
height = size * 1<br/>
SH = (height / 13)<br/>
SW = size * 1.9<br/>
BW = size * 0.5385<br/>
BL = size * 0.76<br/>
#--basic shapes--#
WR = rectangle(width, height, "solid", "white")<br/>
RS = rectangle(width, SH, "solid", "red")<br/>
BR = rectangle(BL, BW, "solid", "blue")<br/>
#--place image code--#
CR = place-image(RS, SW,SH, WR)<br/>
\\\
<br/>
<br/> 
what you see above includes code that controls the proportions of the flag by using the size attribute in order to update the size of the entire image. this part of the code is operational which is a good thing now all I need to do is make sure that I have all the basic shapes I need in order to make up the flag and to overlap the basic images in order to make the flag come out. I also was trying to figure out how to get the <strong>include<strong/> image-structs library work so I can get the exact colors of the United States flag
