title: Making Connections

This week in computer science, We focused on making connections from previous lessons. For example in the beginning of the week, we discussed the difference between categorical and quantative data. Quantitative data are measures of values that are expressed as numbers and are all about numeric values. Categorical data takes in these numbers and groups them into different categories. Categorical and Quantitative data go hand and hand because one set of data (categorical) separates everything into groups and the information that is being grouped is quantitative data. 

We may have not have seen data in this way in previous weeks however, we have seen data being used in other ways. For instance, when we were creating the Flag project last week, We used data because we had to create images. If you were to look at a function named "circle" for instance, you can see that the circle function takes in certain data in order to produce an image and place them on top of eachother. In a way, the function is considered quantitative data because it is taking in number values and organizing them in a way that will produce an image. Personally, it was sort of hard connect these two concepts and there is most likely a better way to state this connection however, I have seen more then one parallel in the information we have been learning now, and in the past classes. 

There were different points in the week where we were taking about tables and graphs and how to organize that data into these structures. We saw the connection between pyret code and how it organizes data and google sheets. pyret creates a program but can use the data within a google sheets file in order to create a program displaying a table of the given information.

Another thing we talked about was looking through the data set work book and learning about Lookups, Booleans, and other things. I still need some help understanding some of these concepts because it is still confusing because these are new terms that I am learning and it will take time to fully understand what they mean. So far I am understanding some terms and how they connect to data science. For example, Booleans state whether a statment is true or false and when understanding data, this is another way to organized this data using true and false statements.
