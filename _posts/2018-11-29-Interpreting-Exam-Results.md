Earlier in the week, we took a midterm exam that covered most of what we have been learning so far in the Fall semester. In my opinion, the exam was not too difficult. Over the past 2 days we were talking about analyzing the attributes of the exam and identfying the different parts of how we will be graded and what mastery skills were tested. The test was split up into 2 versions and each had the same questions and answers except the question numbers and order of the answer choices were changed around. In this reflection, we will look at one of the questions from the exam and analyze the different parts of the question. 

The question we will be looking at today is question 10 where the question is 
10. What is the value of the following expression?
</br>
(string-length("helloWorld!") + (5 + 4)) / 2
</br>
(a)10
</br>
(b)20
</br>
(c)40
</br>
(d)none of the above
</br>
