title: Contracts and Test Cases

We have been discussing and connecting representations of contracts and test cases this week. We separated functions in math from functions in computer science.There different parts to a contract that are very important or else it will be difficult to view later the very beginning of the week, we learned a new term "<strong>abstraction</strong>" which is a function that repeats over and over again without specifiying it. Defining functions is a type of abstraction.

The difference between contracts and examples is that a contract serves as a plan and the example puts that plan to use using the data the plan gives us. At first, this was difficult to understand however, a classmate used the word "plan" to describe a contract which helped me get a clear understanding of what a contract really was. 
An example of a contract is:
double :: (x :: Number)->Number

We were given a set of word problems in order to help us get some practice in pyret using contracts and examples in order to produce funtions using the information the word problem gave us. the contract above is the solution I came up with for a proper contract to a funtion. using this "plan" I was able to know what the function needed to take in to make my function do something. I then used the contract to create my example which was:
fun double(x): (x * 2) end
