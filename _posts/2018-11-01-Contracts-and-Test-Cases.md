We have been discussing and connecting representations of contracts and test cases this week. We separated functions in math from functions in computer science.There different parts to a contract that are very important or else it will be difficult to view later the very beginning of the week, we learned a new term "<strong>abstraction</strong>" which is a function that repeats over and over again without specifiying it. Defining functions is a type of abstraction.
