In the second semester of freshman year, I took a class called Computational Algebra where I worked with a partner to create a video game that makes an image (also known as the character) collect a target by updating the coordinate that changes the characters position when the arrow keys on the keybord are pressed while avoiding dangers and create a background for the setting of our video game. Last year we used WeScheme which was the coding interface we used to create our video game. My partner and I created a video game about a dinosaur named Kolbey who is in space trying to collect stars while avoiding metors trying to make him loose points. This week we were talking about creating a similar game however using a new language. We talked about the difference between how coordinates work in math and how coordinates work with computers. We saw that in math coordinates work in a coordinate plane with different quadrants involving negative and positve axis where positve increases up and negative decreases down. In computer science, the x-axis increases to the right and the y-axis increases downwards which is different from what we learn in math. I can't wait to create a new game using new learning and a new language!!!
