Yet another week of APCSP. My personal thoughts on the class so far are mixed because I feel that the class gets boring when the teacher is just talking at us instead of letting us experiment on our own. Especially during the time frame that we have the class. We don't get as much done. However I do feel like I am learning something from this class in comparison to last year computer science but I do wish the class can get a little bit more interesting and engaging to make the subject sound fun and that can make students remember better. 

This week we revistied the web and learned more about CSS and began to familiarize ourselves on how the web works and looked at examples of CSS by looking at color codes and how to use them to change certain things within a program to see how the output looks after we change certain things in the CSS. We were also talking about the structure in an HTML document and we analyzed the tags used in an example document and reserched their function and how they contribute to the computer program. I think these concecpts are somehow connected because it takes curtain tags and CSS in order to represent the look of the program and more importantly what the program is supposed to do so you must have an understanding of what the HTML tags mean.

We began talking about creating a program that will construct a flag of our choice and use simple shapes in order to create the flag. Some challenges may be figuring out the code and the color codes in order to create the shapes. Another challenge may be that we will need to figure out the proportions of the flag and its shape. However the class is going good so far.
