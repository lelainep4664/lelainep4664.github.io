Yet another week of APCSP. My personal thoughts on the class so far are mixed because I feel that the class gets boring when the teacher is just talking at us instead of letting us experiment on our own. Especially during the time frame that we have the class. We don't get as much done. However I do feel like I am learning something from this class in comparison to last year computer science but I do wish the class can get a little bit more interesting and engaging to make the subject sound fun and that can make students remember better. 

This week we were talking about the structure in an HTML document and we analyzed the tags used and reserched their function
