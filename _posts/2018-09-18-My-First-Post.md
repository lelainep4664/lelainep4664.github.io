Hi! Welcome to my first post! So far, I created the repository (A.K.A the repo). What is a repository you may ask? A repository acts as a container for a project and its files which is how I was able to create this blog. This blog is made up of a set of folders and files that follow a naming pattern in order to organize the code in which each perform their own job in order to carry out a function within the program. Whether if its the way the web page looks to the words that make up the blog itself. There is still a lot I need to work on in order to make this a proper blog but so far it is going good and is actually not as hard as I thought it would be.
