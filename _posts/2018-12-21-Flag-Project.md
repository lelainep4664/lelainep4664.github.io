## United States Flag by Lelaine Perez

## Describe your program
The country I chose to design for was the Untited States because I thought that I would be able to program the Flag in time however, I didn't exactly finish the flag program so I think that I will overall get a practioner at the most however, the program doesnt exactly run the way I wanted it to since the flag does not scale correctly down to a specific size. so far it only scales to 100 or 200. 


## Current output

## Describe your process.
one thing I wish I did during this project was ask for more help from my teacher instead of solely trying to figure out the problem by myself.
-   What questions, strategies, help from peers or teacher, or thinking got you to this point? _then delete this instruction_
