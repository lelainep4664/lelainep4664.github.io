title : Weekly refection

Here comes another week of Computer Science. A quick summary of what happened during this week is we started to talk about where to start when creating a program in order to teach us to make smaller problems out of a bigger problems. This would be an important skill to learn not only for computer science, but also in life because it should be a habbit to make a major problem and divide it into a small problems so you can go step by step and eventually solve what ever problem you were solving in the first place.
