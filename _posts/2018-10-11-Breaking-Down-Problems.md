title : Breaking Down Problems
---
Here comes another week of Computer Science. A quick summary of what happened during the week is we started to talk about where to start when creating a program in order to teach us to make smaller problems out of bigger problems. This would be an important skill to learn not only for computer science, but also in life because it should be a habbit to take a major problem, and divide it into a smaller problems so you can go step by step and eventually solve what ever problem you were solving in the first place. This is relevant to coding because if you think about it, if you want to create a program there are many problems you will face such as errors in the code, the lack of knowledge on how to do something, and even how interested you are overall at the subject at hand. 

We started one looking into one of our next projects this week which has the class use a programing language called pyret in order to
