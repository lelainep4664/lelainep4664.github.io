<p> 
Hello reader my name is Lelaine Perez. I'm from New York and I am a current High School sophmore at the Academy For Software Engineering taking an AP computer science class. I started coding about a year ago in my freshmen year and worked on a number of projects that used different coding programs such as Scratch, Thimble Mozilla, Ear sketch, WeScheme and others. This year, we will be taking a college level course where we be learning Advanced Placement Computer Science Principles (APCSP) where we will be looking into how to study large data sets in order to draw conclusions from the trends and how to use that data in order for it to do something. Before getting into coding I got into learning how to use Editing programs such as Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator and used it to take drawings I drew on paper and scan it to make it a computerized image of the same image. I am really looking forward to the rest of this year!!!
