<p> 
Hello reader my name is Lelaine Perez. I'm from New York and I am a current High School Senior at the Academy For Software Engineering! This is a digital portfolio of my work in  sophmore year when I took an AP computer science class called Advanced Placement Computer Science Principles. AP Computer Science principles is a college level course where I learned how to study large data sets to draw conclusions from the trends and manipulated that data to get the program to carry out different functions. I started coding in my freshmen year and worked on a number of projects using different coding programs such as Scratch, Thimble Mozilla, Ear sketch, WeScheme and others. Before interested in coding, I  learned how to use Editing programs such as Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator.I used these programs to take drawings I drew on paper and then scan it to make computerized pictures of the drawn image. I am really greatful for the skills I have learned in the past and hope only to keep learning! Thats it from me hope you have a wonderful day!

  Best, Lelaine <3
