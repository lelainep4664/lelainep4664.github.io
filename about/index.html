<p> 
Hello reader my name is Lelaine Perez. I'm from New York and I am a current High School Senior at the Academy For Software Engineering! This is a digital portfolio of my work in  sophmore year when I took an AP computer science class. I started coding in my freshmen year and worked on a number of projects that used different coding programs such as Scratch, Thimble Mozilla, Ear sketch, WeScheme and others. AP Computer Science principles is a college level course where I learned how to study large data sets in order to draw conclusions from the trends and how to use that data in order to do something. Before getting into coding I got into learning how to use Editing programs such as Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator and used it to take drawings I drew on paper and scan it to make it a computerized picture of the same image. I am really looking forward to the rest of this year (even though its a crazy one!).
